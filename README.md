**About app** \
This is my **first pet project**, in which I invested a lot of time and effort. During its development, I consolidated my skills in working with FireBase. 

This is **not a finished version**, but rather presumably what I wanted to recreate from my head. Undoubtedly, it will be refined over time, I would like to add and improve a lot of things. 

The application is a small social network or service, if it can be call like  that. It's like a service where people leave reviews about various companies, but here they can write their **opinions about people**.

The user can register, provide information about himself and put an avatar. After registration, the user can search for people about whom he would like to write his opinion and leave comments, or he can just wait for some opinion to be written about him.

There are 3 types of comments: Good; Neutral; Bad. Comments can be either anonymous or non-anonymous, depending on the wishes of the author.
